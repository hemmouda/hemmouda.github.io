            <span class="fw-bold">W</span>hen climbing mount <tb-kl></tb-kl>, you pass four main points:

            <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yGGwc2g6fodkX4nW6"><ar-md></ar-md></a>,

            <br />
            The journey can be broken into three main stages:
            <ol>
                <li>Arrive in Imlil to rent equipment, hire a guide, and optionally spend the night there or in
                    <ar-md></ar-md>.
                </li>
                <li>Start early from <ar-md></ar-md> for the 6-hour hike to the Toubkal Refuge and stay overnight.</li>
                <li>Begin another early ascent from the refuge to the summit (about 5 hours), then descend all the way
                    back to Aremd or Imlil (7–8 hours).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row mt-3">
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto h1">
            First stage
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto indent">
            <span class="fw-bold">T</span>he journey starts in Imlil, a touristic village (meaning it has restaurants
            and kiosks) that you can reach
            from Marrakesh. The taxis from Marrakesh directly to Imlil are in an area called Sidi mimoun, more
            specifically
            <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xx8e3Vqv53UbwvMy6">here <i class="bi bi-geo no-indent"></i></a>.
            And they cost 35 DH. Alternatively, and even better depending on how you look at it, from the same place,
            you can take a taxi to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rrqGicDmaLnJt7jA6">Asni</a> (a small city on the way
            to Imlil) for 15 DH and then a mini-bus to Imlil for 7.5 DH. The taxis to Asni gets filled quicker.
            <br />
            Once you are in Imlil, you should rent the equipment you'll need (which obviously depends on the season) and
            find a guide that you'll go with. Being accompanied by a guide along side identifying yourself (having a
            CIN) is mandated by the gendarmerie whose check point is on the route, more specifically
            <a href=" https://maps.app.goo.gl/AM3Rf8vyH27hwxUw5">here <i class="bi bi-geo no-indent"></i></a>.
            <br />
            The experience I had with the guide Mostapha (contact information are at the bottom) was more than good, I
            would recommend him. More than that, if you don't count transportation of getting to Marrakech, he is
            cheaper than agencies by a considerable amount (1400 DH
            vs 1800 / 1900 DH on average).

            The rest for the time being
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto indent">
            Alright, I have no time to write this properly and so the rest, for now, is just bullet points:
            <ul>
                <li>The hike from Armed to the Refuge is chill, you will just be walking a lot that's it. No need to
                    wear everything and prepare as if you are climbing K2.</li>
                <li>If you rent clothes or have extra luggage; mules are there that cary your stuff from Armed to the
                    refuge and back from refuge to Armed. This is included in Mostapha's plan and I'm guessing in all
                    other agencies plans.</li>
                <li>If you are extra tired when coming back from the summit, you can ride a mule's back on the way back
                    from the refuge to Armed. Just talk with your guide. They cost 200 DH and I would recommend it even
                    if you are not ired. Those mules 🫏 are goated 🐐!</li>
                <li>Here is the equipment I rented for 300 DH during my winter ascent (23.11.2025):
                    <ul class="second">
                        <li>Softshell pants</li>
                        <li>Hiking boots</li>
                        <li>Crampons</li>
                        <li>One Trekking pole</li>
                        <li>Hardshell jacket</li>
                        <li>Headlamp</li>
                        <li>Thick gloves</li>
                        <li>Warm beanie</li>
                    </ul>
                    and I brought with me and wore a thermal layer, a fleece jacket, thermal pants, gloves, 3 socks,
                    and a face mask. Since these equipments are rented, and some of them cannot be washed, hundred of
                    people have worn what you are going to wear, so it is crucial to wear something of your own that
                    separates your skin from the clothes.
                    <br />
                    I think that the boots I rented were just simple boots, as that they provided no real protection
                    from the cold weather. I would recommend buying your own
                    sturdy boots and then just attaching crampons to them. Maybe these <a
                        href="https://www.salomon.com/en-us/product/toundra-pro-climasalomon-waterproof-ld8639/L40472700">boots</a>
                    that the Luke from the Outdoor Boys recommended? The gloves are also as important. I did the
                    mistakes of renting gloves that were tight. That, I think, cut the circulation to my arm. I think
                    some thick shell mitts would've done the job. I would also recommend an ice axe over
                    trekking poles if you can be safe with one. Plus you can sit on it.
                </li>
                <li>I would highly recommend you bring extra clothes that you can change in when you get to the refuge
                    in the first hike. That way you can shower (in semi warm shower) and spend the evening comfortably.
                </li>
                <li>You don't need a sleeping bag for warmth in the refuge, if you are sleeping in a room with 20 other
                    peoples, it will get really warm. Do not, however, forget to bring ear plugs like I did. People
                    snore and cough. A lot.</li>
                <li>When you get to the refuge, try and sleep early, as that the ascent usually happens at 3 AM.</li>
                <li>You leave your stuff behind in the refuge as you ascend, you only take a bottle of water with you
                    and some little snacks. Dates maybe. I would say around 1.5L of water should be good. I took a
                    small 0.5L bottle with me and I regretted it. Do ration your water, however, even if you bring 1.5L.
                </li>
                <li>As long as you are moving, you wouldn't feel cold, buy you would of course get tired (AF) and feel
                    some sort of dizziness because of the altitude. My feet and hands however were frozen. I stopped
                    feeling my right toes and both of my hands. That's why I'd recommend buying your own sturdy shoes,
                    or maybe it was just the boots from that person I rented from. More on him later. Two weeks after
                    the ascent I still had zero feeling in my right toes, and until now as I'm writing this (around a
                    month later) I barely started feeling something. My hands are fine now however.</li>
                <li>If you are an on and off sport type of guy like me, you would definitely wish that you were on
                    your on phase the 2 months or so before you ascend.</li>
                <li>So that you wouldn't get pranked like we all were, after hours and hours of ascending with nothing
                    near in sight, you will eventually get to a nice place where the sun will start rising, and just to
                    your left you would think that that's the summit. Hahahahaha, it is not my boy. You still have
                    around 30-45 mins of hiking to do.</li>
                <li>When I got to the top, I was so exhausted, so out of breath, that I just sat down, and thought I was
                    going to pass out. I drank almost all the water I had left and ate all my dates. And just sat there
                    dizzy. I wasn't able to enjoy the view. Even 15 minutes later, I was still so tired that I
                    couldn't appreciate the beautiful dotted mountains around me. I would recommend bring 1.5L of water
                    as I said, a good amount of dates, and to be well prepared physically before you go.</li>
                <li>Going back down is easier as that you aren't fighting against gravity, oxygen increases, the sun
                    should be up by now and providing warmth. But it still is a long way down, and you still need to
                    watch out to your steps and in places where the guide tells you to.</li>
                <li>When you get back to the refuge, you eat lunch, and get going back to Armed. Most other agencies, I
                    think, have you back on the transportation bus after that to go home. I stayed an extra night at
                    Mostapha's for 150 DH (this time with no dinner or breakfast), where I took a really good hot shower
                    and slept well.</li>

            <span class="fw-bold">S</span>o, Mostapha the guide that I went with has two brothers. One, called Mohammed,
            which owns the hostel I stayed at the first night as a I got to Imlil. And another, called Said, that rents
            equipment. Top tier family business. Anyhow, as I said, my experience with Mostapha was more than good. I
            would go with him again and stay at his brothers' hostel again. But, I wouldn't rent equipment from Said
            again. It has nothing to do with the guy, he was friendly, and he even took me using his motorbike from his
            shop in Imlil to his brothers' hostel in Armed. But that footwear he gave me, oh no. Boy, I had 3 socks
            on!!! Now that I'm thinking about it, I did accidentally dip my right foot in a little puddle of water on my
            way to the refuge, maybe that was the cause? But my socks got dry after that, I don't know. More over, the
            crampons were kind of detaching every now and then, which is to be expected considering they were worn
            hundred of times... Anyhow, Mostapha and Mohammed's services were great, and that dinner when I got to Armed
            was AMAZING and boiling hot, just what you need in that weather!
            <br />
            This is Mostapha's number, you "contract" with him directly and he handles the rest concerning staying at
            his brother's hostel, the refuge, the food along the way, ext:

            <a id="numAnchor" style="visibility: hidden;"></a>.
            <br />
            Speaking of food, I forgot to mention that my trip with Mostapha for 1400 DH included a really good
            and fulfilling dinner, staying at the hostel in Armed, breakfast, lunch on the route to the refuge, evening
            snack at the refuge, dinner at the refuge, staying at the refuge, breakfast there, lunch again, the mules
            that carry your stuff, and of course him guiding along the way.
            <br />
